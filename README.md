The following created sections in this README.md need to be duly filled, highlighting the denoted points for the solution/implementation. 

**Please feel free to create further sub-sections in this markdown.** The idea is to understand all the particulars of your solution in a singular document.

### Solution Description

```
    We had to create a website for the Forum2k which consists of Landing Page, List of Events Page, Contacts Form as well as
    CRUD operations of Events. 
    So, the solution strategy to achieve the desired task was to keep it minimal as well as user friendly. The frontend was 
    done by React js and we created a hidden path for admin ./admin so that no viewer can temper the events list and added other 
    features accordingly making it secure as well as fun to explore.
    
    The backend was bootstraped using Nodejs and MongoDB which stores the data entered or deleted accprdingly.
